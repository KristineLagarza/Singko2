                    Siargao’s seascape has to be the island’s best feature. Above the water, Siargao enchants tourists with its 
                    palm-fringed white sand beaches and islets. Underwater, Siargao offers just as much beauty underneath the waves.
                    For diving enthusiasts planning to visit Siargao, be sure to include the island diving spots in your itinerary.
                </p>

                    Although it is not yet as famous as other dive spots in the Philippines, there are still places in Siargao where
                    you can dive. Among the most recommended dive spots are the Seeco Reef Coral formation near Naked Island (good
                    for certified open water divers at 11 meters) and the Daku Coral Beach Staghorn Reef at 9 meters. The top diving
                    spot in Siargao, however, is the blue Cathedral. The Blue Cathedral can be found on the wall of Cloud 9's rock entry.
                    It is an underwater wonder with a 20-meter wide hole that features caverns at the north and east side. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take note though that this is advanced divers only. If you’re one, be prepared to find yourself in awe by the vivid
                    formations and the beauty of all the tropical fish swarming the Blue Cathedral.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What’s even better is that you don’t have to go far to get there! It is located within the vicinity of Cloud 9, close
                    enough for you to still watch the master surfers carving up the waves. Just rent a boat from Cloud 9, and you will 
                    be able to get to this underwater cathedral.
