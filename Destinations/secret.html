                <h1>SECRET BEACH</h1>
                <p>
                    Guiwan Beach is one of Siargao's best-kept secrets. Which is perhaps why it is also called the
                    Secret Beach.
                    Only a 15-minute drive from General Luna, this hidden gem can maintain its seclusion because there
                    is no concrete
                    road that leads up to it. Instead, there is only a dirt path through a coconut forest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from its seclusion and beautiful scenery, another charm of Secret Beach is its
                    beginner-friendly surfing waves.
                    Secret Beach has knee and shoulder high swells that are the perfect place for beginners to start.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fact that this strip of beach is typically deserted, only makes it an even more ideal place to
                    learn how to surf. More
                    interestingly, Secret Beach can be surfed all year round thanks to its location; it faces South and
                    is a bit protected from
                    the wind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even if you don't plan to surf, Secret Beach is still an excellent getaway. Listen to the sound of
                    the waves as you soak
                    up the sun. Indeed, the less touristy Secret Beach can promise you a relaxing day at the beach.
