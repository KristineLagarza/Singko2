                <h1>Taktak Falls</h1>
                <p>
                    Being the only waterfall in Siargao and considering its proximity to both Pacifico Beach and Alegria Beach,
                    including Taktak Falls in your itinerary, should be worth it. Although Taktak may not be as grand as other
                    waterfalls the likes of Cebu's Kawasan Falls, Taktak is still a pretty sight. It is also the perfect place
                    to escape the blazing sun as it is in a forested area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks to the generous shade provided by the trees and the chilly waters of the falls itself, cold air will
                    welcome you as you approach the waterfalls. Taktak Falls is 15-meters high; its water softy cascades down a
                    rocky cliff into a small blue-green basin. If you're the adventurous type, you can try cliff-jumping with the
                    local kids. Just be sure to ask them where the safe spots are to make the jump. You can also dip in the cold 
                    waters of the pool, swim around, and snap some photos as souvenirs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to sit back, relax, and enjoy the peaceful ambiance, you certainly can. There are cottages around 
                    the waterfalls where you can lounge in and listen to the flowing water.
